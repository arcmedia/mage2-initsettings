# Magento 2 InitSettings #
Magento is by default set up to run a B2C Store in the USA. In our business cases we more often require settings 
for a B2B shop in Switzerland. This extension automatically makes many settings that we would elsewise have to 
do manually on each installation. Alongside configurations for a Switzerland, it also replaces the hyper-tense 
and often buggy security settings added in later Magento2 releases (2.1 ~ 2.2) with more moderate settings, that 
are still secure but cause much less problems.
